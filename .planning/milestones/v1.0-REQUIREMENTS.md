# Requirements: ModelBlitz

## Notes

- **RPT-09** (OpenRouter baseline comparison): Implemented via informational cost note text. OpenRouter has no latency baseline API, so direct comparison isn't feasible. Intentional simplification accepted in audit.
- **Streaming**: PROJECT.md originally specified SSE; implementation uses Supabase Realtime postgres_changes instead. Functionally equivalent (real-time updates to client), better fit for existing Supabase stack.
